This is a team project for the Software Development Methods and Tools class at MSU Denver. Here we will collaborate to build add-ins for Microsoft Outlook to accommodate various user stories. We will complete a number of two-week sprints throughout the semester and present code that is done (satisfies the user storyâ€™s needs) on demo days.
