# CS 3250-002 Spring 2021
## Team 4

This is a team project for the Software Development Methods and Tools class at MSU Denver.We will complete two-week sprints throughout the semester and present code that is done (satisfies the user story's needs and meets the professor's definition of 'done'). 

Here we are collaborating on an Outlook Add-in that will be able to let the user create custom signatures that are stored in a list. These signatures are able to be selected from a dropdown or dialogue box and added to the end of an email. Eventually these signatures will be email account specific.
